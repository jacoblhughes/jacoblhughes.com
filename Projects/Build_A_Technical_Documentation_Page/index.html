<!--
        Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL.
    Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
    You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

    User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
    User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
    User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
    User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
    User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
    User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
    User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
    User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
    User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
    User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
    User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
    User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
    User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
    User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
    
    User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
    
    You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://gitcdn.link/repo/freeCodeCamp/testable-projects-fcc/master/build/bundle.js
    Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.
    Remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.

                <p>CSS Grid is a very handy and simple way to organize your website layout, allowing you more time to work on your bigger projects (headaches).</p>
                <p>In order to add CSS Grid to your website, simply follow my short tutorial!</p>
                <p>After this quick tutorial you will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add CSS Grid to your website</li>
                    <li>Adjust your layout</li>
                    <li>Understand property settings</li>
                    <li>Set the quantity and dimensions of columns</li>
                    <li>Set the quantity and dimensions of rows</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And remember:</p>
                <code>Coding is fun!</code>
            </section>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Layout">
                <h1>Basic Layout</h1>
                <p>The basic layout of CSS Grid allows you to adjust the number of columns and rows you would like in a "grid".</p>
                <p>An example grid is shown below:</p>
                <div id="example-grid">
                    <div class='example-div'>1</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>2</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>3</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>4</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>5</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>6</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>7</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>8</div>
                    <div class='example-div'>9</div>
                </div>
            </section>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <section class="main-section" id="What_is_'fr'">
                <h1>What is 'fr'</h1>
                <p>'fr' is a unit of length corresponding to a
                    <strong>
                        <u>fr</u>
                    </strong>action of the remaining length.</p>
                <p>An example of using fr:</p>
                <code>width: 1fr;</code>
                <p>This would make the width of your element take up the whole of the remaining length, because you have divided it into 1 fraction!</p>
            </section>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <section class="main-section" id="Add_Grid_Function">
                <h1>Add Grid Function</h1>
                <p>Adding CSS Grid to your website is simple.</p>
                <p>Simply add this line to the container you would like to be a grid:</p>
                <code>display: grid;</code>
                <p>Or you can add:</p>
                <code>display: inline-grid;</code>
            </section>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <section class="main-section" id="Defining_Columns">
                <h1>Defining Columns</h1>
                <p>Columns can be any width you'd like!</p>
                <p>Using CSS Grid properties to define a container that is three even sections:</p>
                <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);</code>
            </section>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <section class="main-section" id="Defining_Rows">
                <h1>Defining Rows</h1>
                <p>Rows can be any width you'd like!</p>
                <p>Using CSS Grid properties to define a container that is three even sections:</p>
                <code>grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);</code>
            </section>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <section class="main-section" id="Summation">
                <h1>Summation</h1>
                <p>Let's wrap it up, your container element would have:</p>
                <code>display: grid;</code>
                </br>
                <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);</code>
                </br>
                <code>grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);</code>
                </br>
                <p>This will create a container with a 3x3 grid taking up 1/3 of the available width and height of the space!</p>
            </section>
